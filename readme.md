# Infogalactic Transporter

There used to exist an extension in the Chrome webstore, called Infosextant, which redirected automatically from Wikipedia to Infogalactic. It disappeared. This is its replacement.

I was unhappy with the original behaviour, however. Sometimes the IG page was missing, or missing new details. It was an annoying process to open up an Incognito window (with extension disabled) in order to get to Wikipedia. 

So, I added functionality such that, when clicking the extension button, you can go back to Wikipedia, if you so desire. And, upon clicking the button again, it takes you back to IG. You can go back and forth to your heart's content!

# Installation

Simply go to the Chrome webstore:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/infogalactic-transporter/majmoinlepbjapaaljlhlfhlmbblaeip

And install!

## Behaviour

- Tab-limited: whatever you do with it in one tab won't affect another. If you press the button (thus disabling the auto-redirect behaviour), and have any other tabs open (or open a new tab), those other tabs will still behave in their default, auto-redirecting way

- Encyclopedia session-limited: your choice is forgotten when you leave. If you click the button (thus disabling the auto-redirect behaviour), and then navigate off to Gab or YouTube or whatever sites you like to visit, the auto-redirect behaviour will be reset.

## The Future

Not exactly plans, but hopes for the future:

- As a user and contributor, allow that person to quickly grab the wiki-marked up text from a Wikipedia page, to quickly and easily grab missing text in the marked-up version, so that they can easily update the corresponding IG page.
